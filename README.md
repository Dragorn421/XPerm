Grant permissions depending on level - Minecraft Bukkit Plugin

### Commands
/xperm reload - Recharger la configuration  
Permission : xperm.xperm (donné par défaut aux op)

### Other
The `xperm.ignore` permission (given to nobody by default) prevents the level of a player to change its permissions. Giving this permission
while the player is online may have unwnated effects until the player logs off and back in.  
Even if you should not use /reload, the plugin won't suffer from it and will work as usual, players won't have to relog to get their permissions.
